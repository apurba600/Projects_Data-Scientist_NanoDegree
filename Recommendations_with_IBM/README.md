## IBM Article Recommendation System

### Introduction:
The goal of this project was to build a recommendation system for IBM's online platform, which hosts articles and resources related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The objective was to recommend articles to users based on their reading history and interactions on the platform.

### Problem Statement:
The challenge was to provide personalized recommendations to the users in a way that is both effective and scalable. With an increasing number of articles being added to the platform and a growing user base, the need for a recommendation system that can handle large amounts of data and provide accurate and relevant recommendations was becoming increasingly important.

### Overview:
The recommendation system was built using a combination of knowledge-based and collaborative filtering techniques, as well as matrix factorization using singular value decomposition (SVD). The system was developed using Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

### Data Cleaning:
The first step in building the recommendation system was to clean and pre-process the data. This involved removing any missing values and irrelevant columns, as well as transforming the data into a usable format. The data was then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.

### Models and Libraries Used:
The recommendation system was built using various machine learning algorithms and libraries, including SVD, KNN, and Random Forest. SVD was used for matrix factorization, which allowed for the reduction of the data into latent features that could be used to make recommendations. 

### Matrix Factorization and Refining Recommendations:
The SVD matrix factorization technique was used to refine the recommendations by reducing the data into latent features. This allowed for the recommendation system to take into account the underlying relationships between users and items and make more accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system was able to take into account the popularity of articles, ensuring that popular articles were recommended to a larger number of users.

### Libraries Used:
The following libraries were used in the development of the recommendation system:

- Pandas: for data cleaning and pre-processing
- NumPy: for numerical computations and array operations
- Scikit-learn: for building and evaluating machine learning models
- Matplotlib: for data visualization

### Recommendations for New Users:
For new users who have not yet interacted with the platform, the recommendation system can make recommendations based on the most popular articles or the latest articles. The system can also make recommendations based on the reading history of similar users, using collaborative filtering techniques.

### Conclusion:
The recommendation system developed for IBM's online platform is a combination of knowledge-based and collaborative filtering techniques, as well as matrix factorization using SVD. The system was built using Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The system provides personalized recommendations to users based on their reading history and interactions on the platform and is able to handle large amounts of data, making it scalable and efficient. The system has the potential to improve the user experience on the platform and increase engagement and retention.

In this project, the focus was on exploring and understanding the behavior of users with regards to the articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. The goal was to develop a recommendation engine that could suggest new articles to users based on their past interactions and preferences. To achieve this, the project was broken down into the following four distinct tasks:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: The first step was to conduct an in-depth analysis of the data to gain insights into the user-article interactions and to identify any patterns or trends.

- Rank Based Recommendations: Next, a rank-based recommendation system was developed to suggest articles to users based on their popularity.

- User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: In this step, a user-user collaborative filtering approach was used to make recommendations. The idea behind this method is that similar users are likely to have similar interests and preferences.

- Matrix Factorization: Finally, the project culminated in the implementation of matrix factorization techniques to make recommendations to users. This approach involves decomposing the user-article interaction matrix into low-dimensional representations that capture the underlying relationships between users and articles.
